# GUI-Activity-MAYM
Our ICS103 Instructor assigned a assignment that requires us to create an application that utilize GUI programming. This is my submission for our ICS103 Assignment. 
My program contains four java classes that utilizes JFrame form. It allows the user to create a diary entry, view each and all entries, and uploads all the inputs or entries to the local directory _(C:/Data/diary.txt)_ of the user.
  - **DISCLAIMER: This project is a WIP.**


However, we are also required create our own Github account and repository. This also serves as an exercise for us to learn how to navigate and utilize Github.
